There is almost certainly something for you.\r\nThere are also some other classes in this project that fit other purposes\r\n* **SimpleLog**\r\nA lightweight class that has various methods for logging into a file\r\n* **Settings**\r\nEasier reading from .properties or .xml files and saving them as soon as you change a setting. The main advantage is, that all the exception-handling is already done.\r\n* **FileUtils**\r\nMethods for safely deleting files or creating dummy files.\r\n* **Security**\r\nMethods for encryting stuff, hashing stuff or getting a HWID of the computer\r\n* **WinRegistry**\r\nNot my code. But useful for accessing the Windows Registry\r\n\r\n[JavaDoc for all the classes](/Essentials/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Twitter](https://github.com/grunzwanzling/twitter)\r\nJust some tests or fun projects with the twitter API\r\n\r\n### Aboerfolge\r\nA bot that checks the top youtubers for subscriber-milestones\r\nIt will automatically tweets those events to [@aboerfolgeDE](https://twitter.com/AboerfolgeDE) and [@subcounterINT](https://twitter.com/subcounterINT)\r\n\r\n### ToneAnalyer\r\nAn experiment which uses the IBM Watson API to check the general mood for a specific trending topic on twitter\r\n\r\n### WelcomeOnTwitter\r\nA bot that would fav all tweets taged with #MeinErsterTweet\r\n\r\n### Letter Of The Day\r\nA bot that generates a random image of a random letter every day and tweets it to [@Lett3rOfTheD4y](https://twitter.com/Lett3rOfTheD4y)\r\n\r\nAll those accounts are powered by [@grunzwanzling42](https://twitter.com/grunzwanzling42)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n* [AnonymousPixels/Essentials](https://github.com/AnonymousPixels/Essentials)\r\n* [Twitter4j](http://twitter4j.org)\r\n\r\n## [TCompress](https://github.com/grunzwanzling/tcompress)\r\nSimple program to compress text using a DNA-repetition searching algorithm.\r\nIt doesn't compress very good and it is not fast at all. It is much more a proof-of-concept\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n* [AnonymousPixels/Essentials](https://github.com/AnonymousPixels/Essentials)\r\n\r\n# Online Profiles\r\nTwitter: [@grunzwanzling42](https://twitter.com/grunzwanzling42)  \r\nSteam:   [Grunzwanzling](http://steamcommunity.com/id/grunzwanzling/)  \r\nSpotify: [grunzwanzling42](https://open.spotify.com/user/grunzwanzling42)  ",
